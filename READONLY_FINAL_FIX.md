# Read-Only Access - Final Fix Strategy

## The Core Problem
The HocuspocusProvider automatically sends an awareness state update when it connects, BEFORE we can prevent it. This causes the server to immediately close the connection with "unauthorized edit attempt".

## Evidence from Logs
1. `awarenessStates: 1` and `localStateExists: true` immediately after connection
2. Server closes connection due to awareness-update being treated as edit
3. `onSynced` never fires because connection is closed

## The Solution
We need to prevent the HocuspocusProvider from sending ANY messages that could be interpreted as edits. However, we've already tried:
- Clearing awareness state after creation (too late)
- Skipping Y.js config updates (helps but not sufficient)
- Destroying awareness (might break the provider)

## Alternative Approach: Read-Only Sync Protocol

Since the current WebSocket sync protocol requires bidirectional communication that the server blocks for read-only users, we should implement a different sync mechanism:

### Option 1: HTTP-First for Read-Only
1. Use HTTP API to fetch initial document state
2. Apply the state to Y.js manually
3. Use WebSocket only for receiving future updates

### Option 2: Custom WebSocket Handler
1. Intercept all outgoing WebSocket messages
2. Block any message types that could be interpreted as edits
3. Allow only sync protocol messages that don't modify state

### Option 3: Server-Side Solution
The most robust solution would be to modify the server to:
1. Recognize read-only connections
2. Allow sync protocol messages but block actual edits
3. Send document state without requiring awareness updates

## Current Status
We've implemented all client-side fixes possible:
- No awareness state updates
- No Y.js config updates
- Clear awareness state after provider creation

But the sync still fails because the HocuspocusProvider's initial handshake includes messages the server rejects.
